        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Tinolang manok or chicken tinola is a nourishing Filipino chicken soup. 
            It can consist of various chicken cuts and internal organs cooked in 
            a flavorful broth alongside green papaya and chili pepper or malunggay 
            leaves. The broth is usually generously seasoned with ginger, garlic, 
            and fish sauce, and the soup is often served over plain white rice.
            Chicken tinola is a staple in every Filipino household and can be enjoyed 
            as a starter or a hearty main course.

        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot and bring it up to medium heat before pouring in the oil. 
                Drop in the onions, garlic and ginger and sauté slowly for about 
                2 minutes or until you can smell the lovely aroma.</li>
            <li>It&apos;s time to drop in the chicken pieces and stir until it turns 
                white or light brown in color.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water and add your Knorr Chicken Broth cubes. Bring this 
                to a simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through.</li>
            <li>You can now add your sayote or green papaya and cook until tender.</li>
            <li>Dahon ng sili is added at the last stage to ensure leaves (and nutrients) 
                don&apos;t dry up. Give this a minute then it is done. Malunggay is also 
                another healthy alternative because it is packed with vitamins and 
                minerals which are good for nursing moms and kids as well.</li>

                whole family light up as you bring this to the table.</li>
