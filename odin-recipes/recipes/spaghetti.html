        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">Filipino spaghetti (also known as sweet spaghetti) is a Filipino adaptation 
            of Italian spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. It has a distinctively sweet 
            sauce, usually made from tomato sauce sweetened with brown sugar and 
            banana ketchup. It is typically topped with sliced hot dogs or smoked 
            longganisa sausages, giniling (ground meat), and grated cheese. It is 
            regarded as a comfort food in Philippine cuisine. It is typically served 
            on almost any special occasion, especially on children's birthdays.

            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 pcs Knorr Pork Broth Cubes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, cook the spaghetti noodles according to package directions. 
                Drain well and set aside. Leave some pasta water for later use.</li>
            <li>Next, get a pan and make it nice and hot over medium heat. Pour 
                some oil and throw in the onions and garlic. Cook until light 
                brown. Then add the ground pork and cook until the color changes.</li>
            <li>Add Knorr Pork Cubes, stir well to dissolve before adding the 
                tomato paste and tomato sauce. Just sauté this for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now, add sugar, pepper and water and continue to simmer over 
                medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes until sauce has slightly 
                thickened. Give this a nice seasoning of salt. You can add 
                more sugar if preferred. You can also use the remaining pasta 
                water to add starch and body to the sauce.</li>
            <li>Now comes the best part! Get a big platter ready for your 
                cooked spaghetti noodles and pour the sauce on top with a 
                sprinkle of grated cheese. And that&apos;s our dish!</li>
            <li>There&apos;s always a party when there&apos;s meaty spaghetti. 
                Have this any day of the week and you&apos;ll surely have a treat!</li>
